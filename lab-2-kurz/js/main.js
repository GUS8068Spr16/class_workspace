Thomas Jefferson stayed with local bricklayer Jacob Graff in 1776 while drafting the Declaration of Independence. By the late 1800s, the home had fallen into disrepair and was knocked down by Penn National Bank. The bank commissioned Frank Furness who combined colonial nods with his signature style to produce a stylish and well loved building that, if existing today, would most likely have protected status. However, the bank left in the 1950s and the building fell into disrepair. In the 1970s the National Park Service decided to buy the land, destroy Furness' creation, and add a reproduction of the Declaration House to the Independence National Monument Park.</p> ";
