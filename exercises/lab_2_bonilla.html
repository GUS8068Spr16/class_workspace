  <b>PHILLY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</b>
  
  
  For many years, Philly is a city that has been considered the underdog when it comes to any field (be it sports, finance or entertainment). 
  In recent years, though, this perception has been challenged. The city's real estate market, encouraged by an influx of new residents, has been booming. This newfound revitalization has positive implications for the city, suggesting a bright economic future.
